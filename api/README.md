*This project aims to deploy a simplified version of the Airbnb website on your server. While we won't be implementing all features, we'll cover essential concepts of the higher-level programming track.*

***The project comprises:***

- ***Command Interpreter***: *A tool to manipulate data without a visual interface, akin to a Shell, facilitating development and debugging*.
- ***Website (Front-end)***: *Displaying the final product to users, combining static and dynamic elements*.
- ***Database or Files***: *Storing data in the form of objects*.
- ***API***: *Providing a communication interface between the front-end and data, allowing retrieval, creation, deletion, and updating of information*.
