## ***Views Directory***


*The ***`Views`*** directory contains modules related to the views of our application*.

### ***Files***:

-***`__init__.py`***: This file serves as an indicator to Python that the `Views` directory should be treated as a package. It can include initialization code or be left empty if not needed.

- ***`amenities.py`***: This module contains views related to amenities in our application.

- ***`cities.py`***: This module contains views related to cities in our application.

- ***`index.py`***: This module contains the main index view of our application.

- ***`places.py`***: This module contains views related to places in our application.

- ***`places_reviews.py`***: This module contains views related to reviews for places in our application.

- ***`states.py`***: This module contains views related to states in our application.

- ***`users.py`***: This module contains views related to users in our application.

# ***Learning Objectives***

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

## ***General***

- ### ***What REST means***
```
REST stands for Representational State Transfer. It is an architectural style for designing networked applications, where resources are identified by unique URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers), and interactions are performed using standard HTTP methods.
```
- ### ***What API means***
```
API stands for Application Programming Interface. It defines a set of rules, protocols, and tools for building software applications. APIs allow different software systems to communicate with each other.
```
- ### ***What CORS means***
```
CORS stands for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing. It is a mechanism that allows resources on a web page to be requested from another domain outside the domain from which the resource originated. It is a security feature implemented by web browsers to prevent cross-origin HTTP requests that are initiated by scripts.
```
## ***What is an API***

- ### ***What is a REST API***
```
A REST API is an API that follows the principles of REST. It uses standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on resources. It typically uses JSON or XML as the data format for representing resources and their states.
```
- ### ***What are other types of APIs***
```
Other types of APIs include SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol), GraphQL, RPC (Remote Procedure Call), and WebSocket APIs. These APIs may have different architectural styles and communication protocols compared to REST APIs.
```
## ***HTTP Methods for REST APIs***

- ### ***Which is the HTTP method to retrieve resource(s)***
```
The HTTP method to retrieve resource(s) is **GET**.
```
- ### ***Which is the HTTP method to create a resource***
```
The HTTP method to create a resource is **POST**.
```
- ### ***Which is the HTTP method to update a resource***
```
The HTTP method to update a resource is **PUT** or **PATCH**. PUT typically updates the entire resource, while PATCH updates only the specified fields.
```
- ### ***Which is the HTTP method to delete a resource***
```
The HTTP method to delete a resource is **DELETE**.
```
## ***How to Request REST API***

- ### ***How to request a REST API***
```
To request a REST API, you typically send an HTTP request to a specific URI (endpoint) using one of the HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE). The request may include additional headers and data, such as query parameters or a request body, depending on the type of operation being performed.
```
*You can use tools like cURL, Postman, or programming languages with HTTP client libraries (e.g., Python's requests library) to make REST API requests programmatically.*
